## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Using this Website is very easy, when you add your database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, you are able to connect to a database using Sequelize. When you enter schema and seed commands, then a development database is created and is seeded with test data. When I enter the command to invoke the application, then my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database. When I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON. When you test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, you are able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
